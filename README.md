# Bounty-Box-Vision

## Description

This project is a pre-trained TensorFlow model capable of object detection. The model uses a bounding box to predict and label each item it identifies. The included `labels.csv` file contains the labels for object detection.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
 
 git clone https://github.com/anthony95macias/Bounty-Box-Vision.git

 cd main.py


2. **Install Dependencies**

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

### Running the Model

- **On macOS/Linux**

python3 main.py


- **On Windows**

python main.py


- **In a Jupyter Notebook**
You can also run the model in a Jupyter Notebook. Simply open the notebook and run the cells containing the code.

### Understanding the Output

The model outputs a bounding box around each detected object and labels it based on the `labels.csv` file. The coordinates of the bounding box and the identified label are displayed for each object.
